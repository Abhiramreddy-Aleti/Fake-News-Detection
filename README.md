# Fake-News-Detection

#Introduction:

Fake news has become one of the most serious problems of our generation. It has a huge impact on our online and offline conversations. Fake news still poses a clear and timely threat to western democracy and social stability. Social media is a huge pool of content and is the most watched part of all the content available to users. Politicians, television stations, newspaper websites, and even the public can post this information. The credibility of these posts is a serious problem in today's world, as many companies are taking steps to educate the public about the dangers of spreading false information. Need to be verified. Manual classification of messages is tedious, time consuming, and biased, so it is not possible to clearly determine the level of reliability of messages posted online.
